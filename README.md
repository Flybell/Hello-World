# Hello-World

Welcome to my Github!

# Who am I?

I am an independent scholar and science communicator. I work as a consultant for the EES and the KLI. If degrees mean anything to you, my background is philosophy of science (PhD), psychology (MS), and the life sciences (BS). 

# Why am I here?

I'm learning graph databases, NLP, ontologies, and knowledge graphs. I opened an account in June 2017 to play around with some agent-based models I'm making for a MOOC course. Messing around with the interface, I quickly realized how useful Github is for research planning and writing. So there's some of that, too.

# What I am doing here?

I have a few private repositories on my research materials. They'll be shared in the spirit of open science after I've experimented a bit more with the interface. My public repository is about the ultimate project-- me. I'm documenting my progress as I self-educate to do more modeling work. I see formalizations as extensions of logical reasoning, the main tool of my field.
