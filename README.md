# Hello-World

Welcome to my Github!

# Who am I?

I am a visiting scholar at University of St. Andrews and science communicator. I work as a comms consultant for the EES and the KLI. If degrees mean anything to you, my background is philosophy of science (PhD), psychology (MS), and the life sciences (BS). I was a postdoc at the ImmunoConcept Lab/PhilinBioMed network at University of Bordeaux/CNRS. Now life is pretty good as I get to explore everything I like without the pressure to climb the academic ladder. 

# Why am I here?

I'm working on projects that involve graph databases, NLP, ontologies & knowledge graphs, text scraping & wrangling, & animation/graphics. I opened a Github account in June 2017 to play around with some agent-based models I'm making for a MOOC course. Messing around with the interface at the time, I used  Github is for research planning and writing. Past Lynn was a true romantic, writing here "My public repository is about the ultimate project-- me. I'm documenting my progress as I self-educate to do more modeling work. I see formalizations as extensions of logical reasoning, the main tool of my field." 

# What I am doing here?

I have a few private repositories on my research materials. What's public are the recent projects I'm using to build skills & possibly make a contribution. If you go to my project page, you can see how I'm developing my programming skill tree.
